Part E:
goal = ['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8']
start = ['3','1','2','0','7','5','4','6','8']

For this specific starting state, there were a 
total of 5 moves to solve the puzzle. The starting 
state in the instructions was unsolveable.

Part F:
For the same start as part E, the DFS algorithm took
many more moves to solve the puzzle. For a simpler start
state, the DFS still took longer than the BFS. This is because
BFS is good at finding the shortest path or closest node.
DFS struggles with this a bit more.

Part H:
Both options use similar routes, however one is more efficient
than the other. When the moves all have a unit cost, the total
cost of the moves is 5. When the moves have different costs,
it takes a total cost of 6 rather than 5.
